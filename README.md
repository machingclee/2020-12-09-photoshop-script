### Merge Named By Bottom Layer.jsx
<img src="https://github.com/machingclee/2020-12-09-photoshop-script/blob/main/imgs/img_01.jpg" width="400">

The script was found long time ago and recently I fill in the logic when there is no background layer (causing the indexes of layers to change) and when there is just one layer selected.

#### What it does:
- This script merges selected layers with the bottom layer's name being the resulting name.
- When just one layer is selected, and upon merging down, the bottom layer's name will be used.
- When merging a group, it uses the group name for merge.
